\section{Conclusions}\label{sec:conclusions}
Finally, we are aware that our success is closely linked to the growth of the blockchain and web3 industry. We hope that the evolution of decentralized technologies will advance rapidly, thus helping to eliminate current barriers and facilitate a seamless transition to a more decentralized and inclusive digital landscape.

GethDomains, like Dapp at the forefront, is a tangible example of how the mission of simplifying the interaction with resources on decentralized systems can be realized in a concrete way. By allowing users to autonomously manage their domains on Ethereum, the platform promotes a user-centered vision, highlighting the fundamental concept of decentralization.

Through the architecture of the Ethereum blockchain, GethDomains provides an environment in which the user has complete control over their domains, ensuring unprecedented freedom in the use of digital resources. This approach eliminates the risk of censorship and reduces dependence on third parties, transforming the user into an autonomous actor within the decentralized ecosystem.
